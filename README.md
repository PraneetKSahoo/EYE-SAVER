# EyeSaver 

**EyeSaver** is a free and opensource, lightweight, high-performance display utility designed to reduce eye strain during prolonged computer usage. 

Built with Python and native Windows APIs (GDI32), it provides real-time control over screen color temperature and brightness without the resource overhead of Electron-based or commercial alternatives.

## Key Features

*   **Blue Light Filtering:** Adjusts screen color temperature (1500K - 6500K) to align with circadian rhythms and reduce fatigue.
*   **Hardware-Level Dimming:** Utilizes Gamma Ramp APIs to lower screen brightness below standard monitor limitations.
*   **Non-Intrusive:** Minimizes to the System Tray with a negligible memory footprint (<20MB RAM).
*   **Zero Dependencies:** Standalone portable executable; no installation or admin rights required.
